# Test Case Suggestions for `TowersOfHanoiLogic`

1. **Constructor and Initialization**

   - Should initialize with default values (5 disks, 3 towers).
   - Should clamp number of towers between 3 and 5.
   - Should call reset and initialize towers and moves correctly.

2. **Reset Method**

   - Should reset the game state with the correct number of disks (clamped between 3 and 6).
   - Should place all disks on the first tower in descending order.
   - Should clear previous moves and set currentMoveIndex to 0.
   - Should generate the correct number of moves for 3, 4, and 5 towers.

3. **Move Generation**

   - Should generate the correct sequence of moves for 3 towers and 3 disks (classic solution).
   - Should generate a valid move sequence for more than 3 towers.
   - Should use auxiliary towers efficiently when more than 3 towers.

4. **nextStep Method**

   - Should perform the next move and update towers and currentMoveIndex.
   - Should return the correct GameState after a move.
   - Should return null if all moves are completed.
   - Should not move disks if the move is invalid (disk is undefined).

5. **getCurrentState Method**

   - Should return the current state of towers and isAnimating as false.
   - Should reflect the correct state after several moves.

6. **isComplete Method**

   - Should return false before all moves are completed.
   - Should return true after all moves are completed.

7. **getTotalMoves Method**

   - Should return the correct total number of moves for a given number of disks and towers.

8. **getCurrentMoveIndex Method**

   - Should return 0 after initialization or reset.
   - Should increment after each nextStep call.

9. **Edge Cases**

   - Should handle minimum and maximum allowed disks and towers.
   - Should handle reset with different disk numbers after some moves.
   - Should not mutate internal state when no moves are left.

10. **Auxiliary Methods**

    - Should select a valid auxiliary tower in findBestAuxTower.

These suggestions cover constructor, state management, move logic, edge cases, and internal helper methods.
